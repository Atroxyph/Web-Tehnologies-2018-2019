		<h2>What our application will offer</h2>
		<p> 
			Our application will mainly offer services concerning information related to security.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Namely, it will utilize the web services already provided by certain web applications such as Google Search, 
			Google Safe Browsing, Shodan and HaveIBeenPwned - with the help of their APIs, which - upon proper usage, will provide 
			to us the queried information in JSON format - which we will have to decode and utilize accordingly.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I will go on to explain briefly how each of these APIs will help us in our app.
		</p>	
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>Google Search</h3>
				<p>
					We will utilize this application in order to be able to search articles and general information on the WWW 
					with regard to security.
				</p>			
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Shodan</h3>
				<p>
					Shodan - also known as "Dark Google" will provide us the ability to search for security vulnerabilities/exploits 
					and inform us certain properties of theirs such as their author, the platform the exploit is intended for 
					as well as the code itself (be careful if you plan on using it!).
				</p>			
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Google Safe Browsing</h3>
				<p>
					This will consist of a search form where a user will be able to introduce several website URLs to check if 
					their are known to be malicious or not.
				</p>			
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>HaveIBeenPwned</h3>
				<p>
						This one is pretty self-explanatory. We will provide a simple search form to the user where he/she will 
						be able to introduce his/her e-mail to check whether it is known to have been compromised in a past 
						security breach.
				</p>			
			</li>
		</ul>
