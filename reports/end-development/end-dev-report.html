			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>

				This document serves as a descriptive report of the assignments that each team member has tackled during the ending period of the development of this application. <br/><br/>

				I will proceed by briefly presenting what each developer has done.

				<h3>2.3. Popescu Flavius Petru</h3>

				<p>

					Unfortunately, due to recent events that transpired w.r.t Flavius' status within this course, he has thus not made it past the intermediary development of the project. <br/><br/>

					You could consider this an unfortunate casualty in our team. <br/><br/>

					Hence, what has been achieved w.r.t this project's back-end development is a result of myself and Daniel's work.

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>

			This has been a short report with regard to the outcome of the end development period. For more information w.r.t this app's provided services <strong>and</strong> the app itself, see the other resources provided along with this document. (including the user guide) <br/><br/>
