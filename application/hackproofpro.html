				<h2>Hackproof Programming</h2>

				<h2>What I mean by "Hackproof" Programming</h2>

				<p>This particular term of "hackproof" programming is in fact misleading - or - <em>rather - would be</em> far more misleading had I not care to stress the <strong>quotes</strong> around "hackproof".</p>

				<p>Therefore, what I actually mean by "hackproof" is not what would one normally consider - that is, being able to engineer software <strong>completely free</strong> of any weaknesses/penetration points that would allow hackers to just swarm in and take advantage of said weakness(es).</p>

				<p>What I <strong>do</strong> mean by "hackproof" is actually much less evident.</p>

				<p>My experience and my own intuition in fact tells me that there is and there <em>never will be</em> any such software system that is absolutely invulnerable to suffering from certain weak points in its design.</p>

				<p>So what <em>am I</em> actually saying here? Am I directly contradicting myself? Am I simply <em>wasting</em> your time as an ambitious reader and consumer of information?</p>

				<p>The answer is: <strong>No.</strong> Let me care to elaborate.</p>
